📌 # Full Implementation Plan for Workwise

This plan outlines the architecture, modules, database structure, logging logic, performance optimizations, and deployment strategy, organized into implementation phases with specific steps.

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Environment Setup & Architecture Foundation

a. [x] Set up development environment with Rust and Tauri dependencies
b. [x] Create project structure and configuration files
c. [ ] Initialize PostgreSQL database instance
d. [x] Create basic Tauri + React/TypeScript project scaffold
e. [x] Set up version control and project documentation

## 🔄 Phase 2: Core Logging Engine Implementation 

a. [ ] Implement keystroke capture functionality with window context
b. [ ] Add active window title tracking and switch detection
c. [ ] Create basic screenshot capture mechanism
d. [ ] Integrate Tesseract OCR for text extraction from screen
e. [ ] Implement image hashing algorithm for visual difference detection
f. [ ] Create adaptive screenshot logic based on window changes and content differences

## 💾 Phase 3: Database Integration

a. [ ] Implement PostgreSQL schema with required tables and indexes
```sql
CREATE TABLE logs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
    window_title TEXT NOT NULL,
    keystrokes TEXT DEFAULT '',
    screenshot BYTEA,
    ocr_text TEXT,
    session_end TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```
b. [ ] Create batch insert logic for reduced database writes
c. [ ] Implement offline mode with local queue system
d. [ ] Add retry mechanism for database connection failures
e. [ ] Create sync process for offline-stored data

## 🎛️ Phase 4: User Interface Development

a. [ ] Design and implement settings panel UI components
b. [ ] Create user preference storage system in local config file
c. [ ] Implement toggles for keystroke logging enable/disable
d. [ ] Add screenshot capture controls and sensitivity settings
e. [ ] Create database configuration interface
f. [ ] Implement pause/resume logging functionality
g. [ ] Add visual indicators for active logging status

## ⚡ Phase 5: Performance Optimization

a. [ ] Optimize background processes for minimal CPU and RAM usage
b. [ ] Implement Tokio async processing for efficiency
c. [ ] Add screenshot compression before storage
d. [ ] Optimize OCR processing to prevent redundant captures
e. [ ] Implement smart throttling of resource-intensive operations
f. [ ] Add profiling and performance monitoring

## 📦 Phase 6: Deployment & Distribution

a. [ ] Implement macOS accessibility and screen recording permission handling
b. [ ] Set up code signing process:
   ```
   codesign -s - -f --deep path/to/binary
   ```
c. [ ] Create .dmg installer package for macOS
d. [ ] Configure macOS Launch Daemon for background operation
   ```
   ~/Library/LaunchAgents
   ```
e. [ ] Implement auto-start on login functionality
f. [ ] Set up Tauri auto-update mechanism
g. [ ] Create installation and user documentation

## 🧪 Phase 7: Testing & Quality Assurance

a. [ ] Create automated test suite for core functionality
b. [ ] Perform stress testing with high volume data capture
c. [ ] Test database resilience and recovery mechanisms
d. [ ] Validate resource usage under various conditions
e. [ ] Conduct security audit of data capture and storage
f. [ ] Perform usability testing of settings interface

## 🚀 Architecture Overview

### Key Components
| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Rust Core Service | Background process that captures keylogs, screenshots, and window titles |
| Tauri GUI | User-friendly settings interface for enabling/disabling tracking and configuring database settings |
| PostgreSQL Database | Centralized storage for logs, screenshots, and session tracking |
| OCR & Image Processing | Uses Tesseract OCR and image hashing to optimize screenshot captures |

### Functional Highlights

- **Adaptive Screenshot Logic**: Only captures new screenshots when meaningful changes occur (>15% pixel difference or >30% OCR text difference)
- **Efficient Database Strategy**: Batch inserts every 5 seconds to reduce database load
- **Offline Resilience**: Local storage queue with automatic sync when connection is restored
- **Minimal Resource Footprint**: Optimized for background operation with minimal CPU/RAM usage
